# ACAS Xu Visualization

[<img src="sim.png" width="50%">]

This animation shows closed-loop simulations of the ACAS-Xu systex [1], using the onnx runtime and assuming the vertical seperation of the aircraft is 0.

The main code it run is make_animation.py. You an edit the code directly if you want to switch between creating an mp4 file and plotting to the screen.
