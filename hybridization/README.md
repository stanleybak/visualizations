# Hybridization and Dynamics Scaling

This visualization uses the vanderpol oscillator system to explain hybridization (piecewise linearization for verification) and error reduction using dynamics scaling. This was described in [1].

Note: making all videos takes ~12 hours (I went a little overboard on the framerate / number of points).

The system dynamics are:

x' = y

y' = (1 - x^2) * y - x
